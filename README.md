# Webpage-Portfolio

My webpage portfolio as a self-taught developer.

I wanted to put together a landing page that would act as a webpage portfolio showing off my projects & some of the skills I have acquired thus far. I would like to eventually add a section about my backend experience which i am currently working on.
